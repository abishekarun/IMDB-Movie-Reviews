## IMDB Movie Reveiws - Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we try to predict whether the movie reviews obtained from IMDB are positive or negative using neural networks. This project was done as a part of Udacity Neural Networks Foundations Nanodegree program.

The Final rendered version with Bokeh Plots is [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abishekarun/IMDB-Movie-Reviews/blob/master/Sentiment_MLP.ipynb) for this project. The results obtained using keras can be seen [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/IMDB-Movie-Reviews/blob/master/Sentiment_keras.ipynb).
The results obtained using Recurrent Neural Network can be found [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/IMDB-Movie-Reviews/blob/master/Sentiment_RNN.ipynb)
