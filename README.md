## IMDB Moive Reveiws - Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we try to predict whether the movie reviews obtained from IMDB are positive or negative using neural networks. This project was done as a part of Udacity Neural Networks Foundations Nanodegree program.

The Final Notebook is [here](https://github.com/abishekarun/Boston-Housing/blob/master/boston_housing.ipynb) for this project.
